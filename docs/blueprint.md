## Style Guidelines:

- Primary background: Dark gray (#101010) for a high-contrast, quiet feel.
- Card/container background: Slightly lighter gray (#181818) to subtly lift elements from the background.
- Primary text (headlines): White (#FFFFFF) for clear, readable headings.
- Secondary text (paragraphs): Light gray (#b0b0b0) to soften the text against the dark background.
- Accent: Electric Jade (#00FF99) for small details like the logo spark, tech tags, and focus rings.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for all text, headlines and body, to maintain a consistent, modern aesthetic. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Simple mono icons (SVG), with accent jade used sparingly for visual interest.
- Max content width: 1100px, centered, with a strict 8px spacing system for consistent and clean spacing.
- Minimal motion with purposeful micro-interactions (opacity/translate 4–8px, 150–250ms, ease-out) for a subtle user experience.
